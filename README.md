File handling for saving/loading user data

How It Works 📝

Users can browse products, add/remove items from the cart, and checkout.

Loyalty points are earned for each action and can be applied to discounts.

Mystery boxes give random products for fun surprises.

Mood-based recommendations suggest products matching your mood (e.g., Chill → Cozy items).

User data (cart + loyalty points) is saved to a file, so your progress is persistent.
